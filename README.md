# Backstory

I have always been curious about the world and how things work. Me day comprises largely of me setting behind my laptop screen writing code, reading and watching videos. 

I learn a lot on daily basis; either on tech subjects, psychology, biology, physics, astronomy or business. I often desire to share my experiences and sometimes I do on social media (facebook, twitter, etc) but doing so always felt inappropriate and largely goes unnoticed (rightly so). 

People on social media are there to, well, talk about daily events and have light conversation. Learning is a gradual process and mostly accumulative and learning experiences can be a hard topic to talk about or attract attention to. 

My experience with learning has been consistant for the decades and always felt like a continuous unraveling of a knowledge map of sort. My learning process has patterns, forward and backward links between learnt subjects and byproducts. 

Oftentimes people share their learning experiences via blog posts in the format of explaining the subject matter or teaching others. 

The aim here is to find a meaningful way to share learning experiences (not the learning itself), new knowledge, skills and discoveries to share with like minded people. I think that will be a kick ass tool.


# The River

A liver is commonly used metaphor to represent the flow of life. A river can also represent a number of concepts during the learning journey of a person. 

Branching streams which later rejoin could represent someone's acquiring knowledge to support whatever they are currently working on, and integrating it back later on. 

A river could branch into a dry land turning into it green as representation of learning a new subject. Ponds and water reservoir can from by a river possible for accumulation and new contributions to knowledge. 

A river can form waterfalls which might represent a climax of understanding an conquer a challenge.  

Thoughts are welcome :)
